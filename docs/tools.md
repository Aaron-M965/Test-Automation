| Features                            | **Selenium**                        | **Ranorex**                               | **Newman (CLI for Postman)**             |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Purpose**           | UI/browser automation                     | UI testing with built-in recorder + API support | API testing automation via Postman collections |
| **Language Support**          | C#(.NET)                                  | C# (.NET)                                       | JavaScript (Node.js CLI)                       |
| **API Testing Support**       | ⚠️ Limited (via code only) **Helpers** | ✅ Supported via `HttpClient` in user code    | ✅ Full (runs Postman API tests via CLI)       |
| **UI Testing Support**        | ✅ Yes                                    | ✅ Yes (Web, Desktop, Mobile)                   | ❌ No                                          |
| **Low-Code/No-Code Features** | ❌ None                                   | ✅ Drag-and-drop GUI for beginners              | ❌ CLI-based only                              |
| **Integration in CI/CD**      | ✅ Fully supported                        | ✅ Built-in CI integrations (Jenkins, Azure)    | ✅ Excellent (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.)   |
| **Data-Driven Testing**       | ✅ With files or DBs                      | ✅ Built-in data connectors (Excel, DB, CSV)    | ✅ Via Postman data files                      |
| **Test Reporting**            | ✅ With plugins (ExtentReports, Allure)   | ✅ Built-in + customizable                      | ✅ CLI, JSON, or HTML with reporters           |
| **Test Maintenance**          | ⚠️ Code-based                           | ✅ GUI and modular test design                  | ✅ Uses maintainable Postman collections       |
| **Recommended For**           | Web UI automation                         | End-to-end functional & regression testing      | API testing in automation pipelines            |
| **Example Use Case**          | Automating login flows, form inputs       | Testing full workflows including UI & APIs      | Validate API flows before/after UI tests       |

## ✅ Recommendations

- **Use Selenium** when:

  - You need flexible **web UI automation** across multiple languages.
  - You're comfortable writing code and want full control.
  - You want to integrate with tools like **ExtentReports**, AutoIt, or custom frameworks.
- **Use Ranorex** when:

  - You want a **powerful yet beginner-friendly** UI and API testing tool.
  - You need to automate **desktop, web, or mobile apps** in one suite.
  - You want **visual scripting**, **modular tests**, and **CI/CD support** with minimal code.
- **Use Postman (Newman)** when:

  - You’ve built **API test collections in Postman**.
  - You want to **automate API validation** in your CI/CD pipelines.
  - You need to **prepare environments or validate services** before Selenium or Ranorex runs.
